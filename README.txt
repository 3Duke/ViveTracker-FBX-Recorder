A very lightweight recorder for Vive Trackers that exports motion files as FBX.
V1.0 has been made entirely by Reyna https://twitter.com/Forfaox
I made all changes starting from V1.1 on and will further try to help in case there are any issues.
There should also be a tutorial on how to use this to create mixed-reality footage on my channel in the future.

The main purpose is to track a camera and additional objects for combining Blender Animations with real-life footage, but without the limited and complicated camera tracking in post production that we can't use when filming in a greenscreen studio or when filming close-ups.

This has been tested to work with blender to create animation overlays for filmed footage with a tracker on top of the camera.
You can also use this for motion capture, since it is tracking all your devices including controllers and your headset.

This program is using the FBX SDK: https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-sdk-2020-0
And the OpenVR SDK: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr
