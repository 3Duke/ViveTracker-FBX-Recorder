A very lightweight recorder for Vive Trackers that exports motion files as FBX.
V1.0 has been made entirely by Reyna https://twitter.com/Forfaox

This is currently untested and Work-In-Progress!
I will try to add more features in the future.

The goal is to track a camera and additional object for combining Blender Animations with real-life footage, but without the limited and complicated camera tracking in post production that we can't use when filming in a greenscreen studio or when filming close-ups.

This program is using the FBX SDK: https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-sdk-2020-0
And the OpenVR SDK: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr
